# Find optimal Pension selection

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

I want to find the optimal PPM selection for all citizen, to make sure all have the best pre-condition for the selections.
How to select the most optimal pension solution
Today it is up to each citizen to make a lot of choose for pension solutions. If you have no knowledge this can be unfair, and selections can be made wrongly.
I want to find a logarithem that select the most optimal solution for each kind of circumstances (Low salary / Middle salary / High salary / familiy / non family / etc.
I want to limit the risk gaming on the goverment related pensions, (Swedish PPM) and output should be as equal as possible (in %) for all citizens
Datasources needed 
Salary level
Age
Family situation
etc

## Background

* I want a fair system
* I want vizualize the optimal selection
* I want to find a natural time point for review
* etc.


## How is it used?

The solution should be a yearly review, done by all citizens, connected to the tax submission each year.


def main():
   age = ['25', '26', '27', '28'... '70']
   salarylevel = [100000, 150000, 200000, 250000, ... 10000000]   
   Family = [yes, no,]



## Challenges

It can be difficult to handle risks, should it be allowed to take higher risks or should all have same level. What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

I need program skills, and knowledge of possible selections.
